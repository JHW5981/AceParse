\section{Conclusion}
After proposing a tool for uncovering and quantifying the present bias in text-to-image models, a novel method is proposed for mitigation. By learning and applying latent directions $d_{Z}$ we demonstrate it is possible to alter the diverse complex biased relations, such as those in cultural events, while maintaining unaltered neutral prompt embeddings. \textbf{Future work} encourages the exploration of more advanced classifiers to find the optimal $d_{Z}$.

%However, our methodology presents the potential impact the initial random Gaussian noise has in these modifications.

% design of more complex models to learn the latent direction

% Moreover, it has demonstrated remarkable adaptability to the diverse challenges of the evaluation directions, being adaptable from gender and race to cultural events and object debiasing.
