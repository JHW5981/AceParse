\begin{abstract}

% Music listening preferences at a given time depend on a wide range of contextual factors, such as user emotional state, location and activity at listening time, the day of the week, the time of the day, etc. It is therefore of great importance to take them into account when recommending music. However, it is very difficult to develop context-aware recommender systems that consider these factors, both because of the difficulty of detecting some of them, such as emotional state, and because of the drawbacks derived from the inclusion of many factors, such as sparsity problems in contextual pre-filtering. This work involves the proposal of a method for the detection of the user contextual state when listening to music based on the social tags of music items. The intrinsic characteristics of social tagging that allow for the description of items in multiple dimensions can be exploited to capture many contextual dimensions in the user listening sessions. The embeddings of the tags of the first items played in each session are used to represent the context of that session. Recommendations are then generated based on both user preferences and the similarity of the items computed from tag embeddings. Social tags have been used extensively in many recommender systems, however, to our knowledge, they have been hardly used to dynamically infer contextual states.

% Summary
% are defined as necessary preconditions
Prerequisites can play a crucial role in users’ decision-making 
% MinCR: not sure this clause helps.  What is it trying to do? Fixed differently.
% \holden{while providing background knowledge}, 
yet recommendation systems have not fully utilized such contextual background knowledge. Traditional recommendation systems (RS) mostly enrich user--item interactions where the context consists of static user profiles and item descriptions, ignoring the contextual logic and constraints that underlie them. 
% MinCR: Rewritten. You have simple spelling and POS errors, please try harder not to introduce new errors with your fixes.
% \holden{For example, 
% the recommendation of an item to a user may be only in the constrain that the user has interacted with % another item, due to the preconditinal knowledge he/she has obtained.}
For example, a RS may recommend an item on the condition that the user has interacted with another item as its prerequisite. 
Modeling prerequisite context from conceptual side information can overcome this weakness. 
We propose Prerequisite Driven Recommendation (PDR), a generic context-aware framework where prerequisite context is explicitly modeled to facilitate recommendation. We first design a Prerequisite Knowledge Linking (PKL) algorithm, to curate datasets facilitating PDR research. Employing it, we build a 75k+ high-quality prerequisite concept dataset which spans three domain.
We then contribute PDRS, a neural instantiation of PDR. By jointly optimizing both the prerequisite learning and recommendation tasks through multi-layer perceptrons, we find PDRS consistently outperforms baseline models in all three domains, by an average margin of 7.41\%. 
Importantly, PDRS performs especially well in cold-start scenarios
with improvements of up to 17.65\%. 
% We further conduct an in-depth study of our induced prerequisite graphs,
% finding intrinsically-motivated induced prerequisite chains. 
% Our extrinsic validation of PDRS shows that the fine-grained modeling of prerequisite knowledge from both the user and item perspectives result in varying efficacy across domains under cold start.
